# 🧠 SovereignTrust Codex

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to the **SDA.Codex**, the official repository of sovereign software patterns, doctrine documents, and sample reference content for the **SovereignTrust** protocol.

This repository provides the canonical definitions and field-tested designs behind the **signal-first, lineage-preserving, memory-sovereign** computing architecture that powers SDA systems like **Fusion**, **Conduction**, and **MemoryBox**.

---

## 🔖 What's Inside

### 📜 Doctrines
Authoritative rulesets that define the behavioral laws of signal-based computing. These are not optional — they form the **binding principles** of any SovereignTrust-compliant implementation.

> Doctrine = Law

Examples:
- `1-1_Signal_Control_Doctrine.md`: Core rules for signal creation, merging, and trace safety
- `1-2_Memory_Mutation_Doctrine.md`: How sovereign memory must be mutated across runtime

---

### 🧰 Patterns
Reusable architectural blueprints for solving common challenges in sovereign systems. These reflect how to build within the rules — enabling flexible, composable design without violating doctrine.

> Pattern = Architecture

Examples:
- `P-000-SignalOrientedExecutionModel.md`: Everything flows through signals
- `P-001-TheRecursiveTransformerModel.md`: Declarative mutation via recursive transformers
- `P-004-ConductionPlanExecution.md`: JSON-defined signal-driven workflows

---

### 🧪 Reference Content
A curated set of sample plans, memory graphs, and execution traces that demonstrate how to use SovereignTrust patterns in practice.

> Reference = Proof

Examples:
- Sample `ConductionPlans` for initializing agents
- Template hydration graphs for modular adapters
- Logs and execution flows using `Start-BondingConduction`

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This codex is intended for:
- Developers building on **SDA Fusion**
- Researchers exploring **AI-symmetric architectures**
- Engineers building **audit-safe decentralized systems**
- Anyone committed to **traceable, reflexive, memory-sovereign computing**

---

## 🔐 Canonical Commitments

- Every function must return a `Signal`
- No memory is mutated directly — only via signal-mediated transforms
- Lineage is never lost — every step is observable, replayable, and sovereign

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Explore the `/doctrines` and `/patterns` folders
3. Review the `/samples` directory for executable test cases
4. Use the patterns to extend your own SovereignTrust-compliant systems
