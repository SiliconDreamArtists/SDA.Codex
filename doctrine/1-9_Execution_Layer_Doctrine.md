# 🏛️ Execution Layer Doctrine v1.1

## 📖 Title
**Execution Layer Doctrine**

## 🌟 Purpose
Defines sovereign execution flow in SovereignTrust systems, including Executors, Routers, Queues, and Condensers. Ensures every action is traceable, signal-verified, and memory-mutative.

---

## I. Execution is Memory-Bound

- All execution must originate from a `Signal`.
- Execution context is passed as a `ConductionSignal`.
- Memory is mutated only through:
  - `Add-PathToDictionary` for writes
  - `Resolve-PathFromDictionary` for reads

---

## II. Executors Are Conduction-Aware Agents

- Executors must:
  - Accept a `$ConductionSignal` or `$ConductionJacket`
  - Wrap their operation in a `Signal` result
  - Register all results back into the Graph
- Executors **must not mutate state directly** — only via signal-bearing routines.

---

## III. Routers Are Lineage Dispatchers

- Routers inspect incoming Signals for:
  - `Pointer` (payload or source)
  - `ReversePointer` (originating agent or phase)
  - Role and Phase metadata
- Routers must:
  - Select a Conduction Plan
  - Route the signal into Hydration and Phase execution
  - Return a signalized result

---

## IV. Queues Are Sovereign Relays

- Queues are declared as `MappedNetworkAdapters`
- Every queued message must:
  - Be relayed through `Emit → Relay → Queue`
  - Pass through the `Router` before invocation
- Queues must:
  - Validate Signals via Gate or Token
  - Wrap any retrieved job in a new `Signal` for routing

---

## V. Hydration Precedes Execution

- Signals may contain **Hydration Tokens** (`{{Path}}`)
- Hydration passes must:
  - Use `HydrationCondenser` before execution
  - Resolve inline memory, adapter, or environment references
- Execution may then proceed to **Phase Plan** or **MapCondenser**

---

## 🔒 Compliance Rule

**Do not allow execution unless the signal has passed through:**

Router → Hydration → Gate → Queue → Conduction

Each step must be signal-traced and mutation-compliant.

---

## 🌀 Closing Principle

Execution is not a method call — it is a sovereign memory ritual.
Only signal-traced, hydrated, and lineage-bound operations may execute.
