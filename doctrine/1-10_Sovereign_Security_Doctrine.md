# 🏛️ Sovereign Security Doctrine

## 📖 Title
**Sovereign Security Doctrine v1.1**

## 🌟 Purpose
Formalizes identity, tokenization, adapter security, and agent permission delegation within SovereignTrust systems. All access must be declarative, lineage-traceable, and gated by signal-verified memory.

---

## I. Identity Is Tokenized and Scoped

- Every agent must possess a `Token`
- Tokens may be:
  - `@TKN:` → Encrypted or ephemeral secure tokens
  - `@MEM:` → Inline memory references
- Tokens are scoped to:
  - `Environment`
  - `Role`
  - `Attachment`
- Hydration of tokens must occur via `HydrationCondenser` or `TokenCondenser`, not raw access.

---

## II. Secrets Must Be Hydrated, Not Stored

- No Graph or Signal may contain raw secret values.
- All secrets must:
  - Be hydrated from external secure sources (e.g. vaults)
  - Be accessed via token merge (e.g., `{{Secrets.ApiKey}}`)
  - Be resolved using a `Signal` with full lineage
- Use `Resolve-TokensFromGraph` or `TokenCondenser` during hydration phase.

---

## III. Adapters Must Be Verified and Declared

- All Adapters must be resolved from a Jacket and stored in memory:
  - `MappedStorageAdapters`, `MappedNetworkAdapters`, etc.
- Each Adapter must declare:
  - `Kind` → e.g., Storage, Network, Execution
  - `Slot` → PrimaryContent, Archive, Secrets
  - `Scope` → ReadOnly, ReadWrite, Execute
- Adapters must pass `.Verify()` or `.Test()` before use.

---

## IV. AI Agents Must Declare Attachments

- AI agents may not perform operations unless:
  - They possess a valid, scoped `Attachment`
  - The attachment is declared via memory and gated via `Authorize-Gate.ps1`
  - Their actions are signalized and merged into the memory lineage
- Agents may carry a `.ReversePointer` to indicate who delegated them

---

## V. Gate Verification Is a Signal, Not a Check

- Use `Authorize-Gate.ps1` or a similar function that returns a `Signal`
- The signal must show:
  - Who requested access
  - What token or role was validated
  - Whether access was granted or denied
- Logs must be merged into the Graph’s control signal

---

## 🔒 Compliance Rule

**All identity, memory, and action boundaries must be enforced via memory-bound signals. No access is allowed without adapter verification, token hydration, and traceable agent delegation.**

---

## 🌀 Closing Principle

Sovereign security is not enforced through firewalls —  
It is enforced through memory-traceable, recursive, signal-bound trust.
