# üì°üß† Signal-Oriented Execution Model (SOEM)

## A Pattern for Fully Traceable, Sovereign-Controlled Computation

### üîç Summary

The **Signal-Oriented Execution Model (SOEM)** is a software design pattern in which **every function, state mutation, and execution step is wrapped in or mediated by a Signal object**. This ensures that all memory changes, data flows, and execution lineage are:

- **Observable**
- **Replayable**
- **Sovereign-compliant**
- **Composable**

### üîß Core Principles

1. **All State Flows Through Signals**  
   No memory or property is read or written directly. Instead, values are passed via `.Result`, `.Pointer`, or `.Jacket` inside Signal objects.

2. **Signal-in / Signal-out Function Structure**  
   Every function accepts a `[ConductionSignal]$Signal` as its first parameter and returns an evolved signal ‚Äî never raw objects.

3. **Memory Sovereignty**  
   State is mutated using `Add-PathToDictionary` and accessed via `Resolve-PathFromDictionary`. No object graphs are directly altered ‚Äî everything passes through sovereign trace paths.

4. **Lineage and Traceability**  
   Signals carry `.TraceID`, `.ConductionID`, `.ReversePointer`, and `.Result`, enabling reconstruction of full execution history and memory origin.

5. **Reflexive Execution**  
   Signals can carry Plans, Intents, or Subgraphs inside themselves, allowing recursive, runtime-defined behaviors (e.g., ConductionPlans, Template Hydration, Agent Bootstraps).

6. **Unified Diagnostic Surface**  
   Errors, warnings, logs, and state can all be emitted through `MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure`, `LogInformation`, and `LogCritical` ‚Äî no external logging system required.
