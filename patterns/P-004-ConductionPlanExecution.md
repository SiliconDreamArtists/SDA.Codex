# 🧠🗺️ Conduction Plan Execution

## A Pattern for Intent-Driven, Sovereign Signal Sequences

### 🔍 Summary

**Conduction Plan Execution** is a sovereign runtime pattern that enables **declarative, trace-safe control flows** by interpreting JSON-based *ConductionPlans* inside a `Signal`. These plans define a sequence of actions, logic branches, or hydrations that are **executed entirely through Signals**, preserving memory lineage and runtime introspection.

This pattern transforms static configuration into **live, sovereign behavior** — enabling reflexive AI systems, adaptive workflows, and sovereign memory orchestration.

### 📘 Key Concepts

- **ConductionPlan**: A declarative JSON blob defining one or more actions to perform, often indexed by keys like `Action`, `TargetPath`, `Strategy`, `Intent`, or `GraphID`.
- **ConductionSignal**: The sovereign runtime object carrying the plan and context.
- **SignalFlow Engine**: Executes the plan by invoking transformer functions or graph walkers step-by-step.
- **ResultSignal**: The final Signal returned after all steps are complete, preserving `.Result`, `.TraceID`, and diagnostics.

### 📋 Example ConductionPlan

```json
{
  "Plan": [
    {
      "Action": "Hydrate",
      "TargetPath": "$.Agents[*].Roles",
      "TemplatePath": "$.Templates.Role.Default",
      "Mode": "Inject"
    },
    {
      "Action": "RunGraph",
      "GraphID": "Initialize.Agent"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan first hydrates agent roles, then triggers a named graph execution.

---

### 🔁 Execution Lifecycle

1. Plan is attached to `.Plan` or `.Intent` inside a `Signal`
2. Signal is passed into a `Start-ConductionPlanExecution` function
3. Each step is dispatched to a transformer or adapter
4. The result Signal is merged and carried forward
5. Errors, warnings, and intermediate outputs are logged into `.Entries[]`
6. Final Signal is returned with `.Result` or `.Pointer` updated

---

### ✅ Benefits

- **Declarative**: Control flow is externalized from code into structured plans
- **Composable**: Plans can reference templates, subgraphs, or other plans
- **Traceable**: All execution steps are logged inside the Signal
- **Safe**: Errors are catchable, recoverable, and lineage-preserving
- **Runtime-Driven**: Systems can evolve behavior at runtime without code changes

---

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Imperative chains with no lineage  
- Hardcoded workflows baked into function bodies  
- Plans not embedded in a Signal or passed without `.Start()`  
- Direct calls to functions without using `Signal` as input/output wrapper

---

### 🧩 Integration Patterns

- **Signal-Oriented Execution Model**: The execution substrate
- **Recursive Transformer Model**: Used for nested template hydration
- **GraphCondenser & MappedFormulaAdapter**: Tools to execute nested or referenced plan graphs
- **Signal-Wrapped Functions**: Each plan action maps to a sovereign-compliant function
