### 🔍 Summary

**Sovereign Graph Expansion** is a structural pattern that enables the **dynamic growth of memory graphs** through signal-mediated, lineage-preserving transformations. Rather than statically constructing object trees or DAGs, this pattern recursively **expands graphs from sovereign memory** using transformer functions, Condensers, and GraphPlans.

Each expansion is traceable, reflexive, and compliant with the SovereignTrust execution model — allowing AI systems to construct and evolve memory graphs in real time without violating introspection or control principles.

### 🧬 Core Concepts

- **Graph Nodes**: Sovereign memory units (`Signal`, `Jacket`, `Adapter`, `Plan`, etc.) stored in a navigable structure
- **Expansion Signal**: The initiating Signal for graph growth, often containing a `.TargetPath` and `.ExpansionIntent`
- **GraphPlan / FormulaAdapter**: Determines the logic or strategy to use for expanding each node
- **Lineage Safety**: Every expanded node is traceable via `.TraceID`, `.ReversePointer`, and `.Pointer`

---

### 🛠️ Execution Flow

1. Graph seed is passed into a sovereign expansion function (e.g., `Resolve-PathFormulaGraph`)
2. Strategy is selected via a `MappedFormulaAdapter`
3. Each node is resolved and transformed into memory using a Condenser or Plan
4. The process recursively expands into subnodes, tracking lineage
5. Final graph is returned as a Signal with embedded structure in `.Result`

### 📋 Example

```json
{
  "WirePath": "$.Agents[*]",
  "Strategy": "HydrationIntent"
}
```

This strategy expands each `Agent` node using the `HydrationIntentCondenser`, wiring roles, adapters, or runtime surfaces into each one from declared templates.

---

### ✅ Benefits

- **Declarative Graph Growth**: No imperative wiring — all nodes are hydrated via intent or template
- **Traceable Structure**: Every node in the graph carries sovereign lineage
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Expand based on conditions, templates, or context models
- **Adapter-Aware**: Respects modular mounting rules and transformer logic
- **Memory-Sovereign**: No direct mutation — all graphs are signal-built

---

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Pre-wired object graphs with no introspection
- Manual recursive logic that bypasses sovereign memory
- Using raw arrays or trees that don’t expose `.Pointer`, `.Result`, `.Jacket`
- Static structures in place of dynamic templates or plans

---

### 🧩 Integration Patterns

- **Signal-Oriented Execution Model**: The execution substrate for runtime graphs
- **Conduction Plan Execution**: Many graphs are launched from a Plan node
- **MappedFormulaAdapter**: Strategy dispatcher for sovereign graph wiring
- **Recursive Transformer Model**: The mutation engine for expanding each node
