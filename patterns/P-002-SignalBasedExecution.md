## A Pattern for Intent-Led, Trace-Safe Function Dispatch

### 🔍 Summary

**Signal-Based Execution** is a runtime pattern in which **every action is dispatched, executed, and resolved through a Signal object**. This ensures full traceability, sovereign compliance, and memory-safe flow across the entire execution lifecycle. Unlike traditional call stacks or imperative orchestration, Signal-Based Execution treats every function call as a sovereign event — observed, wrapped, and lineage-bound.

It is a foundational layer in the **SovereignTrust** framework, powering all live computation, adaptation, and dynamic runtime logic flows.

### 🧬 Key Properties

- **Every function receives a Signal** as its first argument (`[ConductionSignal]$Signal`)
- **No function returns data directly** — it returns a mutated or extended Signal
- **Memory is never mutated directly** — only through `Add-PathToDictionary`
- **Inputs, outputs, errors, and lineage** are all traceable inside Signal properties
- **Execution is sovereign** — functions can be paused, resumed, replayed, or rerouted

### 🛠️ Core Mechanics

| Mechanism                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `.Pointer`               | Current node or memory target |
| `.Jacket`                | Sovereign wrapper for context |
| `.Result`                | Final result value emitted |
| `.TraceID`, `.ConductionID` | Lineage anchors for reassembly |
| `LogInformation()`       | Traceable runtime insight |
| `MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure()` | Error-safe chaining and recovery |

---

### 🔁 Execution Lifecycle

1. Signal is created with operation name via `[Signal]::Start("OpName")`
2. Signal is passed into the function
3. Function reads context via `Resolve-PathFromDictionary`
4. Function performs logic
5. Results are stored via `Add-PathToDictionary`
6. Signal is returned with `.Result` and `.Pointer` updated

### 📋 Example

```powershell
function Invoke-ExampleLogic {
    param ([ConductionSignal]$Signal)

    $Signal = [Signal]::Start("Invoke-ExampleLogic") | Select-Object -Last 1

    $valueSignal = Resolve-PathFromDictionary -Dictionary $Signal -Path "$.Input.Value" | Select-Object -Last 1
    if ($Signal.MergeSignalAndVerifyFailure($valueSignal)) {
        return $Signal.LogCritical("Failed to resolve value")
    }

    $value = $valueSignal.GetResult()
    $Signal = Add-PathToDictionary -Signal $Signal -Path "$.Output.Computed" -Value ($value * 2) | Select-Object -Last 1
    return $Signal
}
```

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- Returning raw values instead of Signals  
- Using `$object.Property = value`  
- Catching exceptions without signal integration  
- Mutating state outside of sovereign memory methods

---

### 🧩 Integration Patterns

- **Signal-Oriented Execution Model (SOEM)**: Full sovereign runtime system  
- **Recursive Transformer Model (RTM)**: Declarative memory mutation  
- **Hydration Plan Execution**: Declarative logic dispatch  
- **Adapter-Driven Signal Injection**: Modular behavior expansion
